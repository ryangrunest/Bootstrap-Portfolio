Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is an attempt to recreate my iniital portfolio using Bootstrap instead of vanilla CSS. I still ended up having to use an additional custom style sheet for coloring and other odds and ends. 

Update Jan 28th, 2019:
Cleaned up portfolio page, added shadow css to main content, added footer. cleaned up CSS and HTML code.
